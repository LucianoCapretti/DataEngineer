    "## Profiling and Timing Code\n",
    "\n",
    "When developing data processing pipelines, you often face trade-offs between different implementations. As Donald Knuth famously said: *\"We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "However, once your code is working, it's useful to analyze its efficiency. IPython provides powerful tools for timing and profiling code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Profile\n",
    "\n",
    "- **After code works**: Don't optimize prematurely\n",
    "- **Performance bottlenecks**: Identify slow operations\n",
    "- **Algorithm comparison**: Test different implementations\n",
    "- **Memory usage**: Monitor resource consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "> ‚ö° **Optimization wisdom**: Get it working first, then make it fast!\n",
    "\n",
    "### IPython Timing Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Built-in Commands\n",
    "- **`%time`**: Time execution of a single statement\n",
    "- **`%timeit`**: Time repeated execution for accuracy\n",
    "- **`%prun`**: Run code with profiler\n",
    "- **`%lprun`**: Run code with line-by-line profiler\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extension Commands (require installation)\n",
    "- **`%memit`**: Measure memory use of a single statement\n",
    "- **`%mprun`**: Run code with line-by-line memory profiler\n",
    "\n",
    "> üîß **Extension note**: Line and memory profilers require separate installation of `line_profiler` and `memory_profiler` packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pro Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Start with `%timeit`**: Most accurate for single operations\n",
    "- **Use `%prun` for complex code**: Find bottlenecks in multi-line processes\n",

    "\n",
    "IPython provides two main commands for timing code execution, each with different strengths and use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### %timeit: Repeated Execution Timing\n",
    "\n",
    "`%timeit` automatically runs code multiple times for accurate timing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[1]: %timeit sum(range(100))\n",
    "100000 loops, best of 3: 1.54 ¬µs per loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For slower operations, it automatically adjusts repetitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[2]: %%timeit\n",
    "total = 0\n",
    "for i in range(1000):\n",
    "    for j in range(1000):\n",
    "        total += i * (-1) ** j\n",
    "1 loops, best of 3: 407 ms per loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> ‚è±Ô∏è **Smart timing**: %timeit automatically adjusts repetitions based on operation speed!\n",
    "\n",
    "### When NOT to Use %timeit\n",
    "\n",
    "Some operations shouldn't be repeated. For example, sorting a pre-sorted list is much faster:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[3]: import random\n",
    "L = [random.random() for i in range(100000)]\n",
    "%timeit L.sort()\n",
    "100 loops, best of 3: 1.9 ms per loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is misleading because the list becomes sorted after the first iteration!\n",
    "\n",
    "### %time: Single Execution Timing\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `%time` for operations that shouldn't be repeated:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[4]: import random\n",
    "L = [random.random() for i in range(100000)]\n",
    "print(\"sorting an unsorted list:\")\n",
    "%time L.sort()\n",
    "sorting an unsorted list:\n",
    "CPU times: user 40.6 ms, sys: 896 ¬µs, total: 41.5 ms\n",
    "Wall time: 41.5 ms\n",
    "\n",
    "In[5]: print(\"sorting an already sorted list:\")\n",
    "%time L.sort()\n",
    "sorting an already sorted list:\n",
    "CPU times: user 8.18 ms, sys: 10 ¬µs, total: 8.19 ms\n",
    "Wall time: 8.24 ms\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the huge difference: unsorted (41.5ms) vs sorted (8.24ms)!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cell Magic Versions\n",
    "\n",
    "Both commands work with cell magic for multi-line code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In[6]: %%time\n",
    "total = 0\n",
    "for i in range(1000):\n",
    "    for j in range(1000):\n",
