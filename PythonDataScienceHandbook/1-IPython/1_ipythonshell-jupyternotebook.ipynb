    "## How to Launch an IPython Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "The IPython shell is an enhanced interactive Python interpreter. To launch it, type in the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ipython\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see a prompt like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Python 3.x.x (default, ...) \n",
    "Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information\n",
    "IPython x.x.x -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.\n",
    "In [1]:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Launch a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook provides a browser-based interface for interactive computing. To launch it, run the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will open a new tab in your web browser where you can create and manage notebooks. Each notebook consists of cells that can contain code, text, equations, and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Advantages of IPython Shell\n",
    "- **Quick and Lightweight:** Starts instantly in the terminal, ideal for quick calculations and testing code snippets.\n",
    "- **Enhanced Interactive Features:** Tab completion, magic commands, and improved tracebacks.\n",
    "- **Terminal-Based:** No need for a graphical interface or browser.\n",
    "- **Great for Exploratory Programming:** Useful for trying out ideas, debugging, and running short scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "- **Rich Media Support:** Can display formatted text, images, plots, equations (LaTeX), and interactive widgets.\n",
    "- **Reproducible Workflows:** Code, results, and documentation are saved together in a single file.\n",
    "- **Easy Sharing:** Notebooks can be shared and re-executed by others.\n",
    "- **Step-by-Step Execution:** Run code in cells, making it easy to experiment and visualize results incrementally.\n",
    "- **Ideal for Data Science and Teaching:** Great for tutorials, presentations, and data analysis projects.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use Each\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use IPython Shell When:\n",
    "- You need a fast, interactive Python interpreter in the terminal.\n",
    "- You want to quickly test code, debug, or perform calculations.\n",
    "- You are working on remote servers or environments without a graphical interface.\n",
    "- You prefer working entirely in the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Jupyter Notebook When:\n",
    "- You want to combine code, results, and documentation in one place.\n",
    "- You need to visualize data, create plots, or use interactive widgets.\n",
    "- You are preparing reports, tutorials, or presentations.\n",
    "- You want to share your work with others in a readable and executable format.\n",
    "- You are working on data science, machine learning, or scientific computing projects.\n",
