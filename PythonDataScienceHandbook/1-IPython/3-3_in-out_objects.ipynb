    "## IPython's In and Out Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "IPython automatically creates `In` and `Out` objects that track your input and output history throughout your session.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are In and Out Objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`In`**: A list containing all your input commands\n",
    "- **`Out`**: A dictionary mapping input numbers to their outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📝 **History hack**: These objects let you access and reuse previous results without re-running expensive computations!\n",
    "\n",
    "### How They Work\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [1]: import math\n",
    "In [2]: math.sin(2)\n",
    "Out[2]: 0.9092974268256817\n",
    "In [3]: math.cos(2)\n",
    "Out[3]: -0.4161468365471424\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access input history\n",
    "In [4]: print(In[1])\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access output history\n",
    "In [5]: print(Out[2])\n",
    "0.9092974268256817\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`In` is a list**: `In[1]` = first command, `In[2]` = second command, etc.\n",
    "- **`Out` is a dictionary**: `Out[2]` = output of command 2, `Out[3]` = output of command 3\n",
    "- **Not all commands have outputs**: `import` and `print` statements don't create entries in `Out`\n",
    "- **First element**: `In[0]` is empty (placeholder so `In[1]` refers to first command)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Reuse previous results without re-computing\n",
    "In [6]: Out[2] ** 2 + Out[3] ** 2\n",
    "Out[6]: 1.0  # sin²(2) + cos²(2) = 1 (trigonometric identity)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚡ **Time saver**: Perfect for expensive computations you want to reuse without running again!\n"

    "## Underscore Shortcuts and Output Suppression\n",
    "\n",
    "IPython provides convenient underscore shortcuts to quickly access previous outputs and ways to suppress unwanted output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Underscore Shortcuts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`_`**: Previous output (same as Python shell)\n",
    "- **`__`**: Second-to-last output\n",
    "- **`___`**: Third-to-last output\n",
    "- **`_X`**: Output from line X (shorthand for `Out[X]`)\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚡ **Quick access**: Underscores are faster than typing `Out[number]`!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [1]: math.sin(2)\n",
    "Out[1]: 0.9092974268256817\n",
    "\n",
    "In [2]: math.cos(2)\n",
    "Out[2]: -0.4161468365471424\n",
    "\n",
    "In [3]: _  # Previous output (cos(2))\n",
    "Out[3]: -0.4161468365471424\n",
    "\n",
    "In [4]: __  # Second-to-last output (sin(2))\n",
    "Out[4]: 0.9092974268256817\n",
    "\n",
    "In [5]: _1  # Output from line 1 (same as Out[1])\n",
    "Out[5]: 0.9092974268256817\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Suppression\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a semicolon (`;`) at the end of a line to suppress output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [6]: math.sin(2) + math.cos(2);  # No output displayed\n",
    "In [7]: 6 in Out  # Check if output was stored\n",
    "Out[7]: False  # Output was suppressed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🚫 **Clean output**: Use semicolons when you don't want to see or store results (common with plotting commands)!\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Each\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`_`**: Quick access to last result\n",
    "- **`__`/`___`**: Access recent results without counting\n",
    "- **`_X`**: Access specific line output\n",
    "- **`;`**: Suppress output for cleaner sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🎯 **Pro tip**: Use underscores for quick access, semicolons for clean output, and `Out[X]` for specific historical access!"

    "\n",
    "### Essential History Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`%history`**: Display command history\n",
    "- **`%rerun`**: Re-execute previous commands\n",
    "- **`%save`**: Save commands to a file\n",

    "> 📚 **History power**: These commands let you review, replay, and save your workflow!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Viewing History\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Show first 4 commands\n",
    "%history -n 1-4\n",
    "1: import math\n",
    "2: math.sin(2)\n",
    "3: math.cos(2)\n",
    "4: print(In)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show last 3 commands\n",
    "%history -n -3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show commands containing \"math\"\n",
    "%history -g math\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Re-executing Commands\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Re-run commands 2-4\n",
    "%rerun 2-4\n",
    "\n",
    "# Re-run last 3 commands\n",
    "%rerun -3\n",
    "```\n",

    "#### Saving Commands\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Save commands 1-5 to a file\n",
    "%save my_session.py 1-5\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save last 10 commands\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pro Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`%history?`**: Get detailed help and options\n",
    "- **Use ranges**: `1-5`, `-3` (last 3), `5-` (from 5 to end)\n",
    "- **Pattern matching**: `-g pattern` to filter commands\n",
    "- **File organization**: Save different parts of your session to separate files\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🎯 **Workflow hack**: Use `%save` to create reusable scripts from your interactive sessions!"
