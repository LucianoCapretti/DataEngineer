    "# IPython Shell: Wildcard Matching and Keyboard Shortcuts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wildcard Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "IPython provides powerful wildcard matching capabilities that allow you to search for objects in the namespace using pattern matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Wildcard Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can use wildcards to list every object in the namespace that ends with \"Warning\":\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [10]: *Warning?\n",
    "BytesWarning RuntimeWarning\n",
    "DeprecationWarning SyntaxWarning\n",
    "FutureWarning UnicodeWarning\n",
    "ImportWarning UserWarning\n",
    "PendingDeprecationWarning Warning\n",
    "ResourceWarning\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the `*` character matches any string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern Matching Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [10]: str.*find*?\n",
    "str.find\n",
    "str.rfind\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Essential Keyboard Shortcuts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Navigation\n",
    "- `Ctrl-a/e`: Go to beginning/end of line\n",
    "- `Ctrl-b/f`: Move cursor backward/forward\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🚀 **Efficiency hack**: These keep your hands in the home position - no need to reach for arrow keys!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text Editing\n",
    "- `Ctrl-k`: Cut from cursor to end of line\n",
    "- `Ctrl-u`: Cut from beginning to cursor\n",
    "- `Ctrl-y`: Paste previously cut text\n",
    "- `Ctrl-d`: Delete next character\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚡ **Power user tip**: `Ctrl-k` + `Ctrl-y` is faster than selecting text with mouse!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Command History\n",
    "- `Ctrl-p/n`: Previous/next command\n",
    "- `Ctrl-r`: **Reverse search** (game changer!)\n",
    "  - Searches through entire command history\n",
    "  - Find commands by partial content\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🔍 **Pro tip**: `Ctrl-r` is the most powerful shortcut! Type `Ctrl-r` then start typing any part of a command you used before - it will find it instantly!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Miscellaneous\n",
    "- `Ctrl-l`: Clear screen\n",
    "- `Ctrl-c`: Interrupt current command\n",
    "- `Ctrl-d`: Exit IPython\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🛑 **Life saver**: `Ctrl-c` is essential when you accidentally start a long-running process!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reverse search (`Ctrl-r`)**: The most powerful tool for finding previous commands\n",
    "2. **Wildcards**: Essential for exploring Python's namespace and discovering functionality\n",
    "3. **Practice**: Shortcuts become muscle memory with regular use\n",
    "4. **Efficiency**: Keeps hands in home position for faster typing\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🎯 **Remember**: Start with `Ctrl-r` and `Ctrl-k` - these two shortcuts alone will dramatically improve your IPython workflow!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reverse Search Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The reverse-search can be particularly useful. Recall that in the previous section we defined a function called `square`. Let's reverse-search our Python history from a new IPython shell and find this definition again.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you press `Ctrl-r` in the IPython terminal, you'll see the following prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [1]:\n",
    "(reverse-i-search)`':\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you start typing characters at this prompt, IPython will auto-fill the most recent command, if any, that matches those characters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [1]:\n",
    "(reverse-i-search)`sqa': square??\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At any point, you can add more characters to refine the search, or press `Ctrl-r` again to search further for another command that matches the query. If you followed along in the previous section, pressing `Ctrl-r` twice more gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [1]:\n",
    "(reverse-i-search)`sqa': def square(a):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Return the square of a\"\"\"\n",
    "    return a ** 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have found the command you're looking for, press Return and the search will end. We can then use the retrieved command, and carry on with our session:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [1]: def square(a):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Return the square of a\"\"\"\n",
    "    return a ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "In [2]: square(2)\n",
    "Out[2]: 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You can also use `Ctrl-p`/`Ctrl-n` or the up/down arrow keys to search through history, but only by matching characters at the beginning of the line. That is, if you type `def` and then press `Ctrl-p`, it would find the most recent command (if any) in your history that begins with the characters `def`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Miscellaneous Shortcuts\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there are a few miscellaneous shortcuts that don't fit into any of the preceding categories, but are nevertheless useful to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Keystroke | Action |\n",
    "|-----------|--------|\n",
    "| `Ctrl-l` | Clear terminal screen |\n",
    "| `Ctrl-c` | Interrupt current Python command |\n",
    "| `Ctrl-d` | Exit IPython session |\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Ctrl-c` shortcut in particular can be useful when you inadvertently start a very long-running job.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "While some of the shortcuts discussed here may seem a bit tedious at first, they quickly become automatic with practice. Once you develop that muscle memory, I suspect you will even find yourself wishing they were available in other contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Wildcard matching** (`*` and `?`) helps you find objects in the namespace\n",
    "2. **Navigation shortcuts** keep your hands in the home position\n",
    "3. **Text entry shortcuts** make editing more efficient\n",
    "4. **History shortcuts** (`Ctrl-r`) are incredibly powerful for finding previous commands\n",
    "5. **Practice makes perfect** - these shortcuts become second nature with use\n"
