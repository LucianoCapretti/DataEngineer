    "# IPython Shell: Wildcard Matching and Keyboard Shortcuts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wildcard Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "IPython provides powerful wildcard matching capabilities that allow you to search for objects in the namespace using pattern matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Wildcard Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can use wildcards to list every object in the namespace that ends with \"Warning\":\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [10]: *Warning?\n",
    "BytesWarning RuntimeWarning\n",
    "DeprecationWarning SyntaxWarning\n",
    "FutureWarning UnicodeWarning\n",
    "ImportWarning UserWarning\n",
    "PendingDeprecationWarning Warning\n",
    "ResourceWarning\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the `*` character matches any string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern Matching Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [10]: str.*find*?\n",
    "str.find\n",
    "str.rfind\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Essential Keyboard Shortcuts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Navigation\n",
    "- `Ctrl-a/e`: Go to beginning/end of line\n",
    "- `Ctrl-b/f`: Move cursor backward/forward\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🚀 **Efficiency hack**: These keep your hands in the home position - no need to reach for arrow keys!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text Editing\n",
    "- `Ctrl-k`: Cut from cursor to end of line\n",
    "- `Ctrl-u`: Cut from beginning to cursor\n",
    "- `Ctrl-y`: Paste previously cut text\n",
    "- `Ctrl-d`: Delete next character\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚡ **Power user tip**: `Ctrl-k` + `Ctrl-y` is faster than selecting text with mouse!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Command History\n",
    "- `Ctrl-p/n`: Previous/next command\n",
    "- `Ctrl-r`: **Reverse search** (game changer!)\n",
    "  - Searches through entire command history\n",
    "  - Find commands by partial content\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🔍 **Pro tip**: `Ctrl-r` is the most powerful shortcut! Type `Ctrl-r` then start typing any part of a command you used before - it will find it instantly!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Miscellaneous\n",
    "- `Ctrl-l`: Clear screen\n",
    "- `Ctrl-c`: Interrupt current command\n",
    "- `Ctrl-d`: Exit IPython\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🛑 **Life saver**: `Ctrl-c` is essential when you accidentally start a long-running process!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reverse search (`Ctrl-r`)**: The most powerful tool for finding previous commands\n",
    "2. **Wildcards**: Essential for exploring Python's namespace and discovering functionality\n",
    "3. **Practice**: Shortcuts become muscle memory with regular use\n",
    "4. **Efficiency**: Keeps hands in home position for faster typing\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🎯 **Remember**: Start with `Ctrl-r` and `Ctrl-k` - these two shortcuts alone will dramatically improve your IPython workflow!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reverse Search Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The reverse-search can be particularly useful. Recall that in the previous section we defined a function called `square`. Let's reverse-search our Python history from a new IPython shell and find this definition again.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you press `Ctrl-r` in the IPython terminal, you'll see the following prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [1]:\n",
    "(reverse-i-search)`':\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you start typing characters at this prompt, IPython will auto-fill the most recent command, if any, that matches those characters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [1]:\n",
    "(reverse-i-search)`sqa': square??\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At any point, you can add more characters to refine the search, or press `Ctrl-r` again to search further for another command that matches the query. If you followed along in the previous section, pressing `Ctrl-r` twice more gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [1]:\n",
    "(reverse-i-search)`sqa': def square(a):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Return the square of a\"\"\"\n",
    "    return a ** 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have found the command you're looking for, press Return and the search will end. We can then use the retrieved command, and carry on with our session:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [1]: def square(a):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Return the square of a\"\"\"\n",
    "    return a ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "In [2]: square(2)\n",
    "Out[2]: 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You can also use `Ctrl-p`/`Ctrl-n` or the up/down arrow keys to search through history, but only by matching characters at the beginning of the line. That is, if you type `def` and then press `Ctrl-p`, it would find the most recent command (if any) in your history that begins with the characters `def`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Miscellaneous Shortcuts\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there are a few miscellaneous shortcuts that don't fit into any of the preceding categories, but are nevertheless useful to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Keystroke | Action |\n",
    "|-----------|--------|\n",
    "| `Ctrl-l` | Clear terminal screen |\n",
    "| `Ctrl-c` | Interrupt current Python command |\n",
    "| `Ctrl-d` | Exit IPython session |\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Ctrl-c` shortcut in particular can be useful when you inadvertently start a very long-running job.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "While some of the shortcuts discussed here may seem a bit tedious at first, they quickly become automatic with practice. Once you develop that muscle memory, I suspect you will even find yourself wishing they were available in other contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Wildcard matching** (`*` and `?`) helps you find objects in the namespace\n",
    "2. **Navigation shortcuts** keep your hands in the home position\n",
    "3. **Text entry shortcuts** make editing more efficient\n",
    "4. **History shortcuts** (`Ctrl-r`) are incredibly powerful for finding previous commands\n",
    "5. **Practice makes perfect** - these shortcuts become second nature with use\n"

    "## IPython Magic Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Magic commands are IPython's superpowers! They extend Python with special functionality designed for data analysis and interactive computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Magic Commands?\n",
    "\n",
    "Magic commands are special IPython commands prefixed with `%` that provide enhanced functionality beyond standard Python. They're designed to solve common data analysis problems efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🪄 **Magic fact**: Magic commands are what make IPython \"beyond normal Python\" - they're the secret sauce that makes data science workflows so smooth!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Types of Magic Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Line Magics (`%`)\n",
    "- **Single `%` prefix**\n",
    "- **Operate on one line of input**\n",
    "- **Most common type**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Cell Magics (`%%`)\n",
    "- **Double `%%` prefix** \n",
    "- **Operate on multiple lines of input**\n",
    "- **More powerful, can affect entire code blocks**\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🎯 **Key difference**: Line magics work on the current line, cell magics work on the entire cell (multiple lines)!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Essential Line Magics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### System & File Operations\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%pwd          # Print working directory\n",
    "%ls           # List files (Unix-style)\n",
    "%cd path      # Change directory\n",
    "%mkdir dir    # Create directory\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Information & Help\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%who          # Show all variables in namespace\n",
    "%whos         # Detailed variable information\n",

    "%magic         # List all available magic commands\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance & Timing\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%time         # Time a single statement\n",
    "%timeit       # Time a statement with multiple runs (more accurate)\n",
    "%prun         # Profile code with cProfile\n",
    "%lprun        # Line-by-line profiling\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⏱️ **Pro tip**: `%timeit` is much more accurate than `%time` because it runs multiple iterations and provides statistical information!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Science Specific\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%matplotlib inline    # Display plots inline in notebooks\n",
    "%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'  # High-res plots\n",
    "%load_ext autoreload  # Auto-reload modules when changed\n",
    "%autoreload 2         # Reload all modules automatically\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Essential Cell Magics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Execution\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%%time         # Time entire cell execution\n",
    "%%timeit       # Time cell with multiple runs\n",
    "%%prun         # Profile entire cell\n",
    "%%capture      # Capture output (suppress printing)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### External Code\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%%writefile filename.py    # Write cell content to file\n",
    "%%writefile -a filename.py # Append cell content to file\n",
    "%%bash                     # Execute cell as bash commands\n",
    "%%system                   # Execute cell as system commands\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Analysis\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%%sql                       # Execute SQL queries\n",
    "%%cython                    # Compile cell as Cython code\n",
    "%%javascript               # Execute JavaScript code\n",
    "%%html                     # Display HTML content\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🔥 **Power user combo**: `%%writefile` + `%%run` lets you create and execute Python files on the fly!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Magic Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Debugging & Development\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%debug          # Enter debugger after exception\n",
    "%pdb            # Automatically enter debugger on exceptions\n",
    "%run -d script.py  # Run script in debugger\n",
    "%edit           # Open editor with current line\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Visualization\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%matplotlib inline          # Inline plotting\n",
    "%matplotlib notebook        # Interactive plotting\n",
    "%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'svg'  # Vector graphics\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Package Management\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%pip install package        # Install packages from within IPython\n",
    "%conda install package      # Install conda packages\n",
    "%pip list                   # List installed packages\n",
    "```\n",

    "data = np.random.randn(1000, 1000)\n",
    "result = np.linalg.eig(data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of a useful magic function is %timeit, which will automatically\n",
    "determine the execution time of the single-line Python statement that follows it.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [32]: %timeit L = [n**2 for n in range(1000)]\n",
    "28.4 μs ± 187 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)\n",
