    "## IPython Magic Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Magic commands are IPython's superpowers! They extend Python with special functionality designed for data analysis and interactive computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Magic Commands?\n",
    "\n",
    "Magic commands are special IPython commands prefixed with `%` that provide enhanced functionality beyond standard Python. They're designed to solve common data analysis problems efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🪄 **Magic fact**: Magic commands are what make IPython \"beyond normal Python\" - they're the secret sauce that makes data science workflows so smooth!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Types of Magic Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Line Magics (`%`)\n",
    "- **Single `%` prefix**\n",
    "- **Operate on one line of input**\n",
    "- **Most common type**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Cell Magics (`%%`)\n",
    "- **Double `%%` prefix** \n",
    "- **Operate on multiple lines of input**\n",
    "- **More powerful, can affect entire code blocks**\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🎯 **Key difference**: Line magics work on the current line, cell magics work on the entire cell (multiple lines)!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Essential Line Magics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### System & File Operations\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%pwd          # Print working directory\n",
    "%ls           # List files (Unix-style)\n",
    "%cd path      # Change directory\n",
    "%mkdir dir    # Create directory\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Information & Help\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%who          # Show all variables in namespace\n",
    "%whos         # Detailed variable information\n",
    "%history      # Show command history\n",
    "%magic         # List all available magic commands\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance & Timing\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%time         # Time a single statement\n",
    "%timeit       # Time a statement with multiple runs (more accurate)\n",
    "%prun         # Profile code with cProfile\n",
    "%lprun        # Line-by-line profiling\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⏱️ **Pro tip**: `%timeit` is much more accurate than `%time` because it runs multiple iterations and provides statistical information!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Science Specific\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%matplotlib inline    # Display plots inline in notebooks\n",
    "%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'  # High-res plots\n",
    "%load_ext autoreload  # Auto-reload modules when changed\n",
    "%autoreload 2         # Reload all modules automatically\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Essential Cell Magics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Execution\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%%time         # Time entire cell execution\n",
    "%%timeit       # Time cell with multiple runs\n",
    "%%prun         # Profile entire cell\n",
    "%%capture      # Capture output (suppress printing)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### External Code\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%%writefile filename.py    # Write cell content to file\n",
    "%%writefile -a filename.py # Append cell content to file\n",
    "%%bash                     # Execute cell as bash commands\n",
    "%%system                   # Execute cell as system commands\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Analysis\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%%sql                       # Execute SQL queries\n",
    "%%cython                    # Compile cell as Cython code\n",
    "%%javascript               # Execute JavaScript code\n",
    "%%html                     # Display HTML content\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🔥 **Power user combo**: `%%writefile` + `%%run` lets you create and execute Python files on the fly!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Magic Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Debugging & Development\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%debug          # Enter debugger after exception\n",
    "%pdb            # Automatically enter debugger on exceptions\n",
    "%run -d script.py  # Run script in debugger\n",
    "%edit           # Open editor with current line\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Visualization\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%matplotlib inline          # Inline plotting\n",
    "%matplotlib notebook        # Interactive plotting\n",
    "%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'svg'  # Vector graphics\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Package Management\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%pip install package        # Install packages from within IPython\n",
    "%conda install package      # Install conda packages\n",
    "%pip list                   # List installed packages\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📦 **Convenience hack**: Install packages without leaving your IPython session!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation for other functions can be accessed similarly. To access a general\n",
    "description of available magic functions, including some examples, you can type this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [9]: %magic\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For a quick and simple list of all available magic functions, type this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [11]: %lsmagic\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [12]: %timeit?\n",
    "```\n",

    "Documentation for other functions can be accessed similarly. To access a general\n",
    "description of available magic functions, including some examples, you can type this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Magic Command Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: Timing Code Performance\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Line magic - time a single operation\n",
    "%time sum(range(1000000))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Cell magic - time entire cell\n",
    "%%time\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "data = np.random.randn(1000, 1000)\n",
    "result = np.linalg.eig(data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of a useful magic function is %timeit, which will automatically\n",
    "determine the execution time of the single-line Python statement that follows it.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [32]: %timeit L = [n**2 for n in range(1000)]\n",
    "28.4 μs ± 187 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: File Operations\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a Python file from cell content\n",
    "%%writefile my_function.py\n",
    "def calculate_mean(data):\n",
    "    return sum(data) / len(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run the file we just created\n",
    "%run my_function.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3: System Integration\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Execute system commands\n",
    "%%bash\n",
    "ls -la\n",
    "echo \"Current directory contents:\"\n",
    "pwd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3: Paste\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [26]: def max_custom(x,y):\n",
    "    ...:     return max(x, y)\n",
    "\n",
    "In [27]: print(\"Copy with cmd+c the lines above\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In [28]: %paste<ENTER>\n",
    "def max_custom(x,y):\n",
    "    return max(x, y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A command with a similar intent is %cpaste, which opens up an interactive multiline\n",
    "prompt in which you can paste one or more chunks of code to be executed in a batch\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🎪 **Magic show**: You can mix Python, bash, SQL, and more in the same notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pro Tips for Magic Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Auto-completion**: Type `%` and press Tab to see all available line magics\n",
    "2. **Help**: Use `%magic?` for detailed help on any magic command\n",
    "3. **Configuration**: Many magics can be configured with `%config`\n",
    "4. **Combination**: Use line and cell magics together for powerful workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🚀 **Workflow hack**: Start your data science sessions with `%matplotlib inline` and `%autoreload 2` for the best experience!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reverse search (`Ctrl-r`)**: The most powerful tool for finding previous commands\n",
    "2. **Wildcards**: Essential for exploring Python's namespace and discovering functionality\n",
    "3. **Magic commands**: IPython's superpowers for data science workflows\n",
    "4. **Practice**: Shortcuts and magics become muscle memory with regular use\n",
    "5. **Efficiency**: Keeps hands in home position and automates common tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🎯 **Remember**: Start with `Ctrl-r`, `Ctrl-k`, and `%timeit` - these three tools alone will dramatically improve your IPython workflow!\n",
