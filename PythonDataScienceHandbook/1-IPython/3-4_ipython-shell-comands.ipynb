    "## Shell Commands in IPython\n",
    "\n",
    "IPython lets you run shell commands directly using the `!` prefix and interact with the shell seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Shell Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Prefix any shell command with `!` to execute it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [1]: !ls\n",
    "DataEngineer\n",
    "\n",
    "In [2]: !pwd\n",
    "/Users/lucianocapretti/desktop/projects\n",
    "\n",
    "In [3]: !echo \"printing from the shell\"\n",
    "printing from the shell\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> ðŸ’» **Shell integration**: Run any command line tool without leaving IPython!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capturing Shell Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Save shell command output to Python variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [4]: contents = !ls\n",
    "In [5]: print(contents)\n",
    "['3-understanding_ipythonshell.txt']\n",
    "\n",
    "In [6]: directory = !pwd\n",
    "In [7]: print(directory)\n",
    "['/Users/lucianocapretti/desktop/projects']\n",
    "\n",
    "In [8]: type(directory)\n",
    "IPython.utils.text.SList\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> ðŸ“¦ **Special type**: Output is captured as `SList` (Shell List) with extra functionality!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Passing Variables to Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `{variable}` syntax to pass Python variables to shell commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [9]: message = \"hello from Python\"\n",
    "In [10]: !echo {message}\n",
    "hello from Python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### SList Features\n",
    "\n",
    "The captured output is an `SList` object with additional methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# grep method for filtering\n",
    "files = !ls\n",
    "python_files = files.grep(\"\\.py$\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# fields method for parsing\n",
    "processes = !ps aux\n",
    "user_processes = processes.fields(0)  # Get first column (usernames)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pro Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`!command`**: Run any shell command\n",
    "- **`variable = !command`**: Capture output\n",
    "- **`!command {var}`**: Pass Python variables to shell\n",
    "- **SList methods**: Use `.grep()`, `.fields()`, `.s`, `.n`, `.p` for advanced operations\n",
    "\n",
    "> ðŸ”„ **Two-way communication**: Seamlessly move data between Python and shell environments!\n"

    "## Shell-Related Magic Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "IPython provides magic commands for shell operations that work better than `!` commands for persistent changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Magic Commands Instead of `!`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Shell commands with `!` run in temporary subshells, so changes like `!cd` don't persist:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [11]: !pwd\n",
    "/home/jake/projects/myproject\n",
    "\n",
    "In [12]: !cd ..\n",
    "In [13]: !pwd\n",
    "/home/jake/projects/myproject  # Still in same directory!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> ðŸ”„ **Subshell limitation**: `!` commands don't affect the main IPython session!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Magic Commands for Shell Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `%` prefix for persistent shell operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [14]: %cd ..\n",
    "/home/jake/projects\n",
    "\n",
    "In [15]: %pwd\n",
    "/home/jake/projects\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automagic Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Many shell magics work without the `%` prefix when automagic is enabled:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [16]: mkdir tmp\n",
    "In [17]: ls\n",
    "myproject.txt tmp/\n",
    "\n",
    "In [18]: cp myproject.txt tmp/\n",
    "In [19]: ls tmp\n",
    "myproject.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "In [20]: rm -r tmp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> ðŸª„ **Automagic**: Shell commands work without `%` prefix for seamless experience!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Available Shell Magic Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`%cd`**: Change directory (persistent)\n",
    "- **`%ls`**: List files\n",
    "- **`%pwd`**: Print working directory\n",
    "- **`%mkdir`**: Create directory\n",
    "- **`%cp`**: Copy files\n",
    "- **`%mv`**: Move/rename files\n",
    "- **`%rm`**: Remove files\n",
    "- **`%rmdir`**: Remove directory\n",
    "- **`%cat`**: Display file contents\n",
    "- **`%more`**: Page through files\n",
    "- **`%env`**: Show environment variables\n",
    "- **`%man`**: Show manual pages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pro Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`%automagic`**: Toggle automagic on/off\n",
    "- **Use `%` for persistent changes**: Directory changes, file operations\n",
    "- **Use `!` for one-time commands**: Temporary operations\n",
    "- **Seamless workflow**: No need to switch between terminal and Python\n",
    "\n",
