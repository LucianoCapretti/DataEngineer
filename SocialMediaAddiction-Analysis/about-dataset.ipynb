    "# 📘 Student Social Media & Relationships Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Student Social Media & Relationships** dataset contains anonymized records of students’ social-media behaviors and related life outcomes. It spans multiple countries and academic levels, focusing on key dimensions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Usage intensity  \n",
    "- Platform preferences  \n",
    "- Relationship dynamics  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each row represents one student's survey response, offering a cross-sectional snapshot suitable for statistical analysis and machine-learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌍 Scope & Coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Population:** Students aged 16–25 enrolled in high school, undergraduate, or graduate programs.  \n",
    "- **Geography:** Multi-country (e.g., Bangladesh, India, USA, UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, Brazil, Japan, South Korea).  \n",
    "- **Timeframe:** Data collected via a one-time online survey during Q1 2025.  \n",
    "- **Volume:** Configurable sample sizes (e.g., 100, 500, 1,000 records) based on research needs.  \n",

    "\n",
    "## 📝 Data Collection & Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Survey Design\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adapted from validated scales:\n",
    "  - *Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale*\n",
    "  - Relationship conflict indices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Recruitment\n",
    "\n",
    "- Participants recruited through:\n",
    "  - University mailing lists  \n",
    "  - Social-media platforms  \n",
    "- Diversity ensured in academic level and country\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Data Quality Controls\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Validation:** Required fields + logical range checks (e.g., usage hours between 0–24)  \n",
    "- **De-duplication:** Unique `Student_ID` enforced  \n",
    "- **Anonymization:** No personally identifiable information (PII) collected  \n",

    "| `Age` | Integer | Age in years |\n",
    "| `Gender` | Categorical | “Male” or “Female” |\n",
    "| `Academic_Level` | Categorical | High School / Undergraduate / Graduate |\n",
    "| `Country` | Categorical | Country of residence |\n",
    "| `Avg_Daily_Usage_Hours` | Float | Average hours per day on social media |\n",
    "| `Most_Used_Platform` | Categorical | Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, etc. |\n",
    "| `Affects_Academic_Performance` | Boolean | Self-reported impact on academics (Yes/No) |\n",
    "| `Sleep_Hours_Per_Night` | Float | Average nightly sleep hours |\n",
    "| `Mental_Health_Score` | Integer | Self-rated mental health (1 = poor to 10 = excellent) |\n",
    "| `Relationship_Status` | Categorical | Single / In Relationship / Complicated |\n",
    "| `Conflicts_Over_Social_Media` | Integer | Number of relationship conflicts due to social media |\n",
    "| `Addicted_Score` | Integer | Social Media Addiction Score (1 = low to 10 = high) |\n",

    "## 🔍 Potential Analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correlation Studies:**  \n",
    "  Explore associations between:\n",
    "  - Daily usage hours and mental health  \n",
    "  - Daily usage hours and sleep duration  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Predictive Modeling:**  \n",
    "  - Predict relationship conflicts from usage patterns and platform type\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clustering:**  \n",
    "  - Segment users (e.g., “high-usage high-stress” vs. “moderate-usage balanced”)  \n",
    "  - Explore behavioral trends across countries\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Self-Report Bias:**  \n",
    "  Responses may reflect social desirability rather than actual behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-Sectional Design:**  \n",
    "  One-time survey limits causal inference\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sampling Variability:**  \n",
    "  Online recruitment may exclude students with limited internet access\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📈 Sample Representativeness\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of **707 student responses**, which—assuming a reasonably homogeneous and diverse sample—can be considered statistically significant for exploratory analysis. Although not a probabilistic sample, the size is sufficient to uncover meaningful patterns and correlations across demographics, countries, and behavioral factors. The broad coverage of geographic regions and academic levels further supports the generalizability of preliminary insights derived from this dataset.\n"
